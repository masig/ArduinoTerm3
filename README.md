# Project Summary
Our team has decided to use MinecraftEdu in order to program the term 3 project of this course. Our goal is to create a vault door security system. The following aspects will be programmed to ensure total security: password, player and daytime recognition. Futhermore, we will place and program security turtles around the vault to surveil the area for possible threats.
